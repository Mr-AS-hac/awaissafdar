                    <h2>Learn HTML - in fun way!</h2>
                    <p>To build websites, you should know about HTML â€” the fundamental technology used to define the
                        structure of a webpage. HTML is used to specify whether your web content should be recognized as
                        a paragraph, list, heading, link, image, multimedia player, form, or one of many other available
                        elements or even a new element that you define..</p>

                    <h2>Learn javascript - in fun way!</h2>
                    <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with
                        first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
                        non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.
                        JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting
                        object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. .</p>

                    <h2>Learn Java - in fun way!</h2>
                    <p>Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and
                        secure programming language.Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary
                        of Oracle) in the year 1995.
                        James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was
                        already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.
                        Platform: Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform.
                        Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.</p>

                    <h2>Learn python - in fun way!</h2>
                    <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes
                        code readability with the use of significant indentation.Python is dynamically-typed and
                        garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                        including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It
                        is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
